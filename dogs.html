      <h1 style="color:pink">Dogs increase your mood dramatically!</h1>

      <p>Spending just 15-30 minutes with your dog can help you feel more calm and relaxed, reducing stress and increasing happiness. Playing with your pup increases your brain’s levels of dopamine and serotonin, both of which are neurotransmitters associated with pleasure and tranquility.</p>

     <h1 style="color:pink">Having a dog improves your physical well-being and encourages a healthy fitness.</h1>

   <h1 style="color:pink">They are a reflection of your personality!</h1>
   <p>The kind of dog you have tells people a lot about your personality. A study in England found a very clear correlation between people’s personalities and what type of dogs they owned. For example, people who owned toy dogs tended to be more intelligent, while owners of utility dogs like Dalmatians and bulldogs were the most conscientious.</p>
